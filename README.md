# StereotypicalBreakout
A breakout clone done in python as my exam project in programming C at highschool.
You need to install the latest version of pygame to run this project, using 
â€¢ python -m pip install --upgrade pygame
or
â€¢ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pygame
Then, you just need to run Breakout.py

You can create and change levels by 
* Going into Assets -> Levels
* Open level0.dat
* Read the guide, and then just save new levels as level<level_number>.dat
